## Try this yourself
To Try it yourself, you need to have [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org), Git (i guess thats all)

2. Now use `cd Leveling-Bot` to move inside the folder you just cloned
3. Use `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and change the token value inside it, replace it with your bot's token.
5. Now use `node index.js` to run the bot
